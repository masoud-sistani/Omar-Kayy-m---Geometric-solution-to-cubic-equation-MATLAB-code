Omar Kayyám's Geometric solution to cubic equation. 
To solve the third-degree equation x^3 + a^2x = b Khayyám constructed the parabola x^2 = ay,
a circle with diameter b/a^2, and a vertical line through the intersection point.
The solution is given by the length of the horizontal line segment from the origin to the intersection
of the vertical line and the x-axis.
